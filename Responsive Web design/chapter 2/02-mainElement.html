        <p>The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that document and excludes
content that is repeated across a set of documents such as site navigation links, copyright information,
site logos and banners, and search forms (unless the document or application’s main function is that of
a search form).
It’s also worth noting that there shouldn’t be more than one main on each page (after all, you
can’t have two main pieces of content) and it shouldn’t be used as a descendent child element
of some of the other semantic HTML5 elements, such as article, aside, header, footer, or nav.
